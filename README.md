# Data-Literacy-Project
# 🍽️ What Makes a Popular Meal?

This is a group project from a Data Literacy Course, aimed at understanding what makes meals popular using data analysis and machine learning.

---

## 📌 Objective

Analyze features like calories, ingredients, cuisine, and season to predict meal popularity.

---

## 👥 Collaboration

This was a team effort. My key contributions:
- Built the preprocessing and resampling pipeline (`preprocessing.py`, `resampling.py`)
- Model tuning with Keras Hyperband
- Final reporting and interpretation

Thanks to my teammates: Markus Heimerl, Olha Yarikova.
